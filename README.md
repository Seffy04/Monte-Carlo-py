# Monte-Carlo-py
This project is best launched through a terminal.

## Monte_carlo.py
In this project, I employ the Monte-Carlo stohatic numerical method to do multiple things,
- Estimate the value of pi by using a hypothetical dart board and a million darts, more or less :)
- Estimate the area under a curve for a polynomial (change if needed in func(x))
- Estimate the area under a curve of a gaussian curve
- Estimate the area under curve for a double cos function, cos(cos(pi*x/2))
